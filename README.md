This is a simple registration page created by use of the HTML, CSS, JavaScript.Jquery is the one and only JavaScipt library used in here.Some special methods used to create is displayed in the folloowing.<br>

🛠️In html file I inserted Jquery google CDN using scirpt tags and also Jquery validation plugins.<br> 
🛠️In JavaScript file there are two main parts in validation, first part validate rules second part error messages.<br>
🛠️In rules there are required points while registraion and error messages part there are some text phrases if the required points not fullfilled.<br>
